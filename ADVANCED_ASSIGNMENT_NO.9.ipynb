In Python 3.X, what are the key differences between text-mode and binary-mode files?**  \n","ANS - The major difference between these two is that a text file contains textual information in the form of alphabets, digits and special characters or symbols. On the other hand, a binary file contains bytes or a compiled version of a text file.\n","\n","When a file is opened in **text mode**, reading its data automatically decodes its content (as per the platform default or as per provided encoding), and returns it as a **str**; writing operation takes a **str**, and automatically encodes it before transferring to the file. Text mode files also support universal end-of-line translation, and encoding specification arguments.\n","\n","When a file is opened in **binary** mode by adding a **b** to the mode string argument in the open() call, reading its data does not decode it in any way, and simply returns its content raw and unchanged, as a bytes object; writing takes a bytes object and transfers it to the file unchanged.

The difference between **ASCII** and Unicode is that ASCII represents **lowercase letters (a-z)**, **uppercase letters (A-Z)**, **digits (0–9)** and symbols such as punctuation marks while Unicode represents letters of English, Arabic, Greek etc. mathematical symbols, historical scripts, emoji covering a wide range of characters than ASCII"],"metadata":{"id":"xWvIeklMjYTK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q8. How much of an effect does the change in string types in Python 3.X have on your code?**  \n","ANS - Python 3 stores strings as Unicode by default whereas Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode.
